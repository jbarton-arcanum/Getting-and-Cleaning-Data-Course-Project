# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data
This project was written to meet the objectives for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

Data files avilable from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The original description of the data is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

FILE DESCRIPTIONS
==================================================================

UCI HAR Dataset - Sample data as received from the link above
run_analysis.R - A script that reads in the sample data and manipulates it to output a narrow tidy dataset
        grouped first by participant then by activity.
BartonTidyData.txt - A narrow tidy dataset, as generated by run_analysis.R. 
        See below for a suggested method of reading this file into RStudio.
README.md - Readme file containing a description of the script in this project and how the experiment
        was performed.
Codebook.md - Contains a description of the variables listed in BartonTidyData.R.



JUSTIFICATION OF OUTPUT
==================================================================
The output table (BartonTidyData.txt) is a narrow tidy dataset.
        The average of each variable generated by the study is represented by one column.
        Each row represents one observation I.E.: One activity performed by one person.
        Each participant is repeated for each activity they performed due to this being a narrow 
                format dataset.
        Variable names are listed across the top row and can be referenced in the file Codebook.md.
        As the data is normalized (per the experiment description), units for each observation are omitted.
        These criteria for tidiness were taken from the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course Week 3 video
                "Components of Tidy Data" by Jeffery Leek.



run_analysis.R SCRIPT EXECUTION AND NOTES
==================================================================

To properly execute this script, the data files should be unzipped into the working directory.
The data directory must be named "UCI HAR Dataset", as it is by default.
No changes should be made to any file names or data paths in the data directory.

Per the assignment description, the final tidy dataset is written to a text file (named BartonTidyData.txt).
To read this file back into R appropriately, please run:

BartonTidyData <- read.table("BartonTidyData.txt", header = TRUE)
View(BartonTidyData)

The output table (BartonTidyData.txt) is a narrow tidy dataset.



run_analysis.R SCRIPT DESCRIPTION
==================================================================

The script "run_analysis.R" reads the data contained within UCI HAR Dataset.
The script ignores the additional files contained within the "Inertial Signals" subdirectories
        as per the objectives, they are not necessary and would use uneccessary resources 
        and add excessive complications.

Once read, the measured data as well as participant and activity labels from the source data 
        are compiled into two tables called testdata and traindata.
Column labels are added to alldata to describe what is being measured. 
        Descriptions of what the variable names indicate are available in the file "Codebook.md"

These two tables are combined into one table called alldata that is then further manipulated.
From this table, data describing the activity performed is converted to a human readable value.

Extraneous tables are removed once they are no longer necessary.

Some typographical errors are remedied and the "Activities"" are labeled more descriptively.

Finally, the "alldata" table is then grouped first by participant then activity 
        and averages of all variables are taken.
        
The variables are described per the source data "features_info.txt" in Codebook.MD 
Only mean (mean()) and Standard Deviation (std()) data were considered per the project objectives.



EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION

Per the source data README:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 



For each record it is provided:
==================================================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.



Notes: 
==================================================================
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
